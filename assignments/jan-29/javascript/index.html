            <p class="question">Name the three ways to declare a variable?</p>
            <p><em>var</em>, <em>const</em> and <em>let</em>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="question">
              Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?
            </p>
            <p><em>var</em> because it is considered a bad practice.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="question">
              What rules should you follow when naming variables?
            </p>
            <p>The first character must not be a number.</p>
            <p>
              The name must contain only letters, numbers, "_" or "$" symbol.
            </p>
          </li>

            <p class="question">
              What should you look out for when using the "+" operator with
              numbers and strings?
            </p>
            <p>
              Addition operator produces the sum for numbers or concatenation
              for strings.

          <li>
            <p class="question">How does the "%"" operator work?</p>
            <p>
              Remainder operator returns the remainder left over when one
              operand is divided by a second operand.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="question">Explain the difference between == and ===</p>
            <p>
              Strict equality operator (===) checks whether its two operands are
              equal including data type.
            </p>
            <p>
              Equality operator (==) checks whether its two operands are equal.
              It attempts to convert and compare operands that are of different
              types.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="question">When would you receive a NaN result?</p>
            <p>
              <em>Not a number</em> is a Number property and its value is
              anything but a number. You receive it when you can not to parse a
              parameter in a number.

            <p class="question">
              Explain the difference between prefixing and post-fixing
              increment/decrement operators.
            </p>
            <p>
              Postfix return the value before works on. Prefix return value
              affected by the operator.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p class="question">
              What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?
            </p>
            <p>
              Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are
              evaluated relative to each other. Operators with higher precedence
              become the operands of operators with lower precedence.

            <p class="question">How do you log information to the console?</p>

          <li>
            <p class="question">
              What does unary plus operator do to string representations of
              integers?
            </p>
            <p>It attempts to convert it into a number.</p>

            <p class="question">What are the eight data types in JavaScript?</p>
            <p>
              Null, object, undefined, boolean, number, bigInt, string and
              symbol.
            </p>
          </li>

            <p class="question">
              What is the relationship between null and undefined?
            </p>
            <p>
              They both are falsy and they are used by functions to return a no
              succesful response but they are different.
            </p>
            <p>
              Undefined is a data type wich means there is not value assigned.
            </p>
            <p>Null is a object type and it is a value assigned: null.</p>
          </li>

            <p class="question">
              What is the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes
              for strings?
            </p>
            <p>
              Single and double quotes are not functio0nally different.
              Backticks are used for <em>template strings</em> which allow to
              embed js code.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="question">
              What is the term for embedding variables/expressions in a string?

            <p class="question">
              Which type of quote lets you embed variables/expressions in a

          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="question">
              How do you embed variables/expressions in a string?
            </p>
            <p>
              Using brackets preceded by dollar symbol (${}). Ex: `string
              ${embedded_variable} string`

            <p class="question">
              What is the difference between the slice/substring/substr string
              methods?
            </p>
            <p>
              The <strong>slice()</strong> method extracts a section of a
              string. When slice() receive negative values it counts backwards
              from the end of the string. if indexStart is greater than
              indexEnd, slice() method returns an empty string.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <strong>substring()</strong> method returns the part of the
              string from the start index up to and excluding the end index, or
              to the end of the string if no end index is supplied.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <strong>substr()</strong> method is considered a legacy
              feature in ECMAScript, so it is best to avoid using it if
              possible.

          <li>
            <p class="question">
              What are the three logical operators and what do they stand for?
            </p>
            <p>
              And (&&), Or (||) and Not (!) operators. They are used to
              determine the logic between variables or values.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="question">What are the comparison operators?</p>
            <p>
              Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine
              equality or difference between variables or values.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="question">What are truthy and falsy values?</p>
            <p>
              All values are truthy unless they are defined as false or 0, -0,
              0n, "", null, undefined, and NaN.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="question">What are the falsy values in JavaScript?</p>
            <p>Those values whose evaluation return false.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="question">What are conditionals?</p>
            <p>
              Conditional statements allow us to represent such decision making
              in JavaScript.

            <p class="question">What is nesting?</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="question">What are functions useful for?</p>
            <p>
              A function is similar to a procedure —a set of statements that
              performs a task or calculates a value- but for a procedure to
              qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an
              output.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p class="question">How do you invoke a function?</p>
            <p>With () parenthesis and specified values as arguments.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="question">What are anonymous functions?</p>
            <p>
              It is a function that does not have any name associated with it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="question">What is function scope?</p>
            <p>
              It is the function context and determines the accessibility of
              variables and other resources in the code, like functions and
              objects. JavaScript function scopes can have two different types,
              the locale and the global scope. Local variables are declared
              within a function and can only be accessed within the function.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="question">What are return values?</p>
            <p>
              A value from a function back to the code that called it by using
              the return statement. That value can be a constant value, a
              variable, or the result of the calculation is returned.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="question">What are arrow functions?</p>
            <p>
              An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a
              traditional function expression, with some semantic differences
              and deliberate limitations in usage.
