# Main JavaScript Project

a) Create a blank HTML document. This game is going to be played completely from the console.

b) Your game is going to play against the computer that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’.

c) Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"

i. Make your function’s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive (so users can
input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation).

e) Play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.

iii. Use prompt() to get input from the user. Read the docs here.
