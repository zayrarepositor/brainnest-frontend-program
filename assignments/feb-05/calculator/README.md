# Calculator

a) Your calculator is going to contain functions for all of the basic math operators you typically find on simple calculators, so start by creating functions for the following items and testing
them in your browser’s console.
a. add
b. subtract
c. multiply
d. divide

b) Create a new function operate that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers.

c) Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above functions and
an “Equals” key.
a. There should also be a display for the calculator
b. Add a “clear” button.

d) Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons... you
should be storing the ‘display value’ in a variable somewhere for use in the next step.

e) Make the calculator work! You’ll need to store the first number that is input into the calculator when a user presses an operator, and also save which operation has been chosen
and then operate() on them when the user presses the “=” key.
a. You should already have the code that can populate the display, so once operate()
has been called, update the display with the ‘solution’ to the operation.
b. Figure out how to store all the values and call the operate function with them.
