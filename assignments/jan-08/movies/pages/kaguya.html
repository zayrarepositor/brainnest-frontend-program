                A bamboo cutter named <em>Sanuki no Miyatsuko</em> discovers a
                miniature girl inside a glowing bamboo shoot. Believing her to
                be a divine presence, he and his wife decide to raise her as
                their own, calling her "Princess". The girl grows rapidly,
                earning her the nickname <strong>"Takenoko"</strong> from the
                village children.

                Miyatsuko comes upon gold and fine cloth in the bamboo grove the
                same way he found his daughter.

                Kaguya grows in beauty, attracting suitors. Kaguya tells them
                she will only marry whoever can bring her the mythical treasure
                mentioned.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the night of the full moon, a procession of celestial beings
                descends from the Moon, and Miyatsuko is unable to stop it. An
                attendant offers Kaguya a robe that will erase her memories of
                Earth. They leave, and Kaguya looks back at Earth one last time,
                and cries as she remembers her mortal life, which is now only a
                dream to her.
