                <strong>When Marnie was there</strong> follows
                <em>Anna Sasaki</em> staying with her relatives in a town in
                Kushiro wetlands, Hokkaido. Anna comes across a nearby abandoned
                mansion, where she meets <em>Marnie</em>, a mysterious girl who
                asks her to promise to keep their secrets from everyone. As
                summer progresses, Anna spends more time with Marnie and learns
                the truth about her family and foster care.

                The film featured the final work for Studio Ghibli animator
                Makiko Futaki, who died in May 2016. It was also the final film
                that Yonebayashi directed for Ghibli before he left and joined
                Studio Ponoc.
