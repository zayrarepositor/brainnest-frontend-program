                    An HTML tag is a piece of markup language used to indicate
                    the beginning and end of an HTML element in an HTML
                    document.
                </p>

                What are the three parts of an HTML element?
                <p>
                    An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and

                What is the purpose of the doctype declaration?
                <p>
                    The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser
                    about what version of HTML the page is written in. This
                    ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by
                    different web browsers.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                What is the HTML element?
                <p>
                    The HTML tag represents the root of an HTML document. It is
                    the container for all other HTML elements.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                What is the purpose of the head element?
                <p>
                    The head element is a container for metadata and is placed
                    between the HTML tag and the body tag. Metadata is data
                    about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                What is the purpose of the body element?
                <p>
                    Body tag defines the document's body. It contains all the
                    contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs,
                    images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc. Body tag must be
                    only one in an HTML document.
