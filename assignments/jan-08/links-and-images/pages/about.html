            <ul>
              <li>
                游낸 Tigers are excellent swimmers and can swim up to 3 miles (5
                kilometers) at a time. They are also one of the few cat species
                that enjoy being in the water.
              </li>
              <li>
                游낸 Tigers have a unique set of stripes, much like human
                fingerprints, that are different for each individual. This makes
                it possible to identify individual tigers by their stripes.
              </li>
              <li>
                游낸 The white tiger is a rare genetic mutation that occurs in
                about one in every 10,000 tigers. It is not a separate
                subspecies of tiger.
              </li>
              <li>
                游낸 Tigers have been known to mimic the calls of other animals in
                order to lure their prey closer. This is a behavior that is not
                seen in any other big cat species.
              </li>
              <li>
                游낸 Tigers are solitary animals and prefer to hunt alone, except
                for mothers who are raising cubs.
              </li>
              <li>
                游낸 The stripes on a tiger's skin are not just limited to their
                fur. Even their skin is striped.
              </li>
              <li>
                游낸 Tigers are critically endangered, with fewer than 4,000
                remaining in the wild.
